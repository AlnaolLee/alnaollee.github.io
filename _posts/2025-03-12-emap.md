&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reiterate the general outline of our project: We will have some array of force sensors attached on our paddles, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We determined that an actual computer/laptop will accomplish the same goals at a much better efficiency and quality than using the control box supported by the STM microcontroller. 

, we’ve been thinking about our project a lot more from a users perspective and we’re considering some changes to our design. We’re thinking of getting rid of the control box, and instead adding an extra paddle, and handling a much more complex program on the user's computer. Using the control box limits us to a very basic program for simply measuring the force of a kick. Switching to multiple paddles and a computer program instead would allow a significantly wider range of use, such as having multiple kickers, multiplayer competitions, training regimens, etc. We wanted to get your thoughts on this, we know it’s a significant change but we think it would be significantly more useful for the martial artists, as well as more interesting for us to build since we would be the ones actually using them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We plan to relay this information to our TA Jason for approval.
