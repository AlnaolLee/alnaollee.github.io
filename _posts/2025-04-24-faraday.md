I will change the world.

This is what I tell myself everyday and everytime when I feel like quitting. I simply cannot quit when I have a dream like this. 

I believe everything is possible, and I believe myself to the fullest of myself. 

Michael Faraday, the father of electricity, my inspiration in changing this world.
