# 3/15 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 15th was the beginning of spring break that went until the 23rd. Pretty solid break during the middle of the semester. Usually I would stay back at my apartment on campus during this time, because it is such a short break, but this time I went to travel with some of my friends. We decided to go to Portland, Oregon for a few days. I've never been there, and I was *excited*. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was initially quite indifferent about this trip; yes, I was looking forward to it, because I was going with my friends--even a trip to the local park with your friends is fun--but a part of me sort of wanted to stay behind and relax in my room and catch up on some school work. Now, you might be wondering: *this doesn't sound too exciting by the looks of it.*
But it was. The reason for that was we made a last minute change of plans to go skiing right before our plane to return to campus. That just made this trip something to *really* look forward to. Funnily enough, this had been my third time going skiing just this year. This year in particular, I had lots of fun skiing back in Korea, and I was kind of bummed that I'd have to wait another year to ski. But I was going to one of the snowiest place in the States at this time. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got on the bus from campus that takes up to the airport in Chicago. It is a dreadful 3 hour long bus ride. But it was fine--I've probably slept more on this bus ride over the years than I have during junior year final exams week. I was also accompanied by 3Blue1Brown's *Essence of Linear Algebra* series that I've pre-downloaded the night before. I've had a taste of this series the week before, and it was really fascinating; it had been pretty eye-opening in terms of reviewing the linear algebra concepts I had already known about at an unparalleled perspective. More on this will be on a different blog post once I am finished with the series. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that was pretty much how I killed most of my travelling time. When we arrived in Portland, it was getting pretty late--later than we had anticipated--due to the tornado sightings back in Illinois, delaying our flight. We went to an amazing pho place that we had found before the trip, which tasted even better after having been accustomed to the bland and repetitive Green Street food on campus (Don't get me wrong, there are still a few decent restaurants on Green...It just gets really boring). That was pretty much the first day of the trip. As expected, most of the day was spent travelling.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second day was when most of the "tourist" activities took place. We started off the day with walking around the city, taking pictures and simply admiring the area. We then stopped by a huge book store that sold used books.
