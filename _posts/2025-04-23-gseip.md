Today I came into the lab just because. I was kind of bummed that I couldn't finish the ITO on glass control experiment on monday so I want to do that and see what happened rather than waiting another week. 

to my surprise not showed up. at first it was extremely faint, so i put it inside oven to dry and then the patterns were gone. it was not even visible under the micrscope. I was kinda disappointed by this. I'll try again nexttime. maybe i won't put it in oven this time. 

I tried the uv ozone cleaner today. First I went through the degrease protocol and degreased both ITO on glass and the photomask. then i put both at the same time in the uv ozone cleaner for 30 minutes. i then proceeded with the usual steps and got actually pretty good results. The patterns were mostly inverse plated, but some of the letters only had their outlines plated so it was decent, but not too great either. So I think this ruled out my first hypothesis of ITO initially being dirty then UV cleaning the exposed parts which attracted more gold to it instead of the "dirty" masked patterns. Actually, i guess the hypothesis may hold slightly: the UV can see make the exposed areas more preferred. we don't know yet. im gonna have to think of a way to rule that factor out

Next time, i will do uv ozone cleaner but with initially higher current to see what the interaction there is like.
