today i tried to rule out the water drop in between the ITO and photomask. i did the same steps but without the water drop during VUV exposure for ITO on PET. this resulted in a very blurry electroplating constrast. so i think water just sharpens the contrast of the plating versus the background. i dont think it directly concerns the plating direction. 

chatgpt suggested annealing the ITO before doing the process. so we first tried on ITO on PET at a very low temperature but hot enough. we didn't think it would melt, but it started melting the pet so we stopped immediately. lukas then brought ITO on glass which we annealed for an hour in oxygen at 300 degree celcius. before doing that we measure resistivity then again afterwards. we expected it to decrease in resisitivity but i actually slightly increased which was weird. i then started electrolpating but had to stop in the middle because lab was over. i was sorta iffy about this, having to resume later on, but apparently it didnt really matter, but who knows.
