so most of today was spent resuming electroplating on the annealed ITO on glass. honestly, this might be a factor that needs to be ruled out later. because i observed today that the ITO on PET electroplating without water trial patterns became blurry. although the ITO on glass had water during photolithography, that trial is still evidence that overtime, goldplating can become a little iffy and unstable. anyways, the godlplating was finished and it forward plated! this was very weird and ill show it to dane to see what he thinks. although i think i carried the elcetroplating process for too long, the gold plates became delaminated and started to peel off. 

now for the control experiment, i decided to do just ITO on glass without annealing to see if there is a difference in what kind of substrate the ITO is on, PET vs glass. i did the regular protocol with VUV and then electroplating, but this time the cathode was submerged in water a little, causing the gold to plate on the cathode and not at all at the ITO, i think because cathode is more conductive, the gold all gets attracted there. i will try again next lab. however this is weird because, i think, im not too sure, i also submerged the cathode for the annealed ITO on glass trial. haha. but it worked regardless, so I might have to try that again.
