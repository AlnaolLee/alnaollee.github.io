&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I finished Andrew Ng's *Machine Learning Specialization* from Coursera. It took me right about two months to complete, as expected by Coursera. My hope was to complete this earlier in March, but school and life came in the way. Frankly speaking, however, that is an excuse. Believe it or not, I found out about this course all the way back in 2017. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that was around the time I was a freshman in highschool. I was just getting into programming, but I probably wasn't all that motivated nor was I persistent enough to complete the course. I think I've gotten through the first lecture or something. I regret not doing it then, but I don't stay feeling regretful about it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They say history repeats itself, or that people never learn, or that people never change and whatnot. I am a firm believer of that...but with a condition. I believe that people will never learn or change *unless* they truly strive to differ and wish to bring that willpower to themselves. I believe everyone can change--if they desperately aspire to. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, last summer, history did repeat itself, and I again watched only the first lecture of this course. I was working for a professor in my department, and it was honestly quite stressful--in a reasonable way. So I never kept my promise of starting and finishing that ML course when I got off from work during the day. I was too tired and lazy, honestly speaking. So here I am, this time having kept my promise and finished this course after 8 years. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a couple words, this course was really good. I can strongly advocate for this course to others wanting to have a feel for machine learning. To me, most of the concepts were very straightforward and easy to grasp. Although Professor Ng generally explains very well--much better than most lecturers or professors--on the "why" of concepts, there were a few that I didn't fully get--not the *how*, but the *why*; which were on their own, very fun intellectual adventures for me to really think about. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, this course was great, and I'd recommend it to everyone. However, this course lacks the theory and the mathematics behind a lot of the concepts, and there were a couple that I derived myself for fun. But this is not a problem at all for those with very little to no prior machine learning knowledge, as was I. In fact, I think it *better* for this coursera course to be organized this way. For the true learning experience, it is recommended that you check out Andrew Ng's Stanford CS229 lectures, which I am doing so right now. I think the CS229 course gives a *much* deeper and comprehensive explanation on ML. More of this will be in a seperate blog post, maybe towards mid-May. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've also taken notes on a google doc as I was going through this course. It was made for myself only, but everyone is welcome to check it out. I think it's a pretty decent compilation of the basic ML concepts.
